# Instagram-Group-Message-Bot
I created this bot to mess with my friends whenever they tried to debate in our group chat. Simply update the needed values and it will monitor the group chat for a certain phrase if the bot detects the phrase it will respond with anything you want.
Instagram places their messages in a hidden array making it difficult to automate anything chat related, to bypass this the bot downloads the page source and parses through it counting the amount of times it see's it's prompt.

To use:
Open group_message_bot.py and customize username, password, URL, prompt and fill response array once this is done save changes, launch the group_message_bot.bat file and enjoy!
